**PayPal Website Clone - GIAIC Assignment**
This project is a responsive clone of the PayPal website, built as part of my assignment for GIAIC. Using HTML and CSS, I recreated the core structure and styling, while focusing on making the layout responsive across various devices.

I've put my best effort into optimizing the responsiveness to ensure a user-friendly experience on screens of different sizes. This project has been a great way to sharpen my skills in frontend development, and Iâ€™m continually working to polish and improve it further.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest any enhancements!
